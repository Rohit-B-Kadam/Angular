## Important

- The `<app-root>` tag is where our application will be rendered.
- app-root is a component that is defined by our Angular application.
- This is the fundamental idea behind components: we will teach the browser new tags that have custom functionality attached to them.
- the `ng serve` command live-compiles our .ts to a .js file automatically.
- Decorator is indentify by `@`.
- We can think you decorators as a metadata to our code.
