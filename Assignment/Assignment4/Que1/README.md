### 1.Create Angular Application which contains two components as parent and child component. Send data from parent to child and child to parent.

create application with one child component. Parent component sends data to child
component at the time of creation and child component can send data to parent using the
concept of event.


### What I have done?

1. Delete unnecessary data or file. (like app.component.spec.ts)
2. Generate one component called child component.
3. root component compount will act as parent compount for child component.
4. There will be two button,
    - First button: to send data from parent to child.
    - second button: to send data from child to parent.
