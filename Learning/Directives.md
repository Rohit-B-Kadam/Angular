## Attribute Directives

Change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive. They are usually applied to elements as if they were HTML attributes, hence the name.

Many NgModules such as the RouterModule and the FormsModule define their own attribute directives.

This section is an introduction to the most commonly used attribute directives:

- [NgClass](../Angular6-code/Component_And_Template/Class-Binding/README.md#ngclass-directive) - add and remove a set of CSS classes.
- [NgStyle](../Angular6-code/Component_And_Template/Style-Binding/README.md#ngstyle-directive) - add and remove a set of HTML styles.
- [NgModel](../Angular6-code/Component_And_Template/Two-Way-Binding/README.md#ngmodel-two-way-binding-to-form-elements-with-ngmodel-) - Two way data binding of an HTML form elements.
