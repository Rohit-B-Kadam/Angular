## Why Javascript is removed from Angular

1. __Javascript is losely type language.__

    - One of the great things about type checking is that
        - It helps when writing code because it can prevent bugs at compile time and
        - It helps when reading code because it clarifies your intentions.

    - Return datatype:
        - if we accidentally return anything other than a string in our code, the compiler will tell us that we made a mistake
        - any other developers who want to use this function know precisely what type of object theyâ€™ll be getting.

    - Bug is determine at the time of comipling.
